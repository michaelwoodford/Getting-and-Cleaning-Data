The codebook describing the variables within the initial data set can be found here:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The variables that were extracted from this dataset (ie those indicating a mean or standard deviation) can be found within the list below - note that each variable would therefore contain 2 columns, one indicating the mean and the other indicating the standard deviation:
tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

More detail desribing the variables can be found within the original documentation.

Please note that each feature has been normalized so that it is bound within the range of [-1 1].

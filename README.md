Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
=========================

This repository contains the work completed for the Coursera course 'Getting and Cleaning Data'. The code book desribing the variables is also included within this repository. 

The attached script works by extracting and merging the supplied data before extracting only that which refers to means and standard deviations. 

The script then tidies up the data so that each subject and activity has each own separate row before outputting the result to a text file.
